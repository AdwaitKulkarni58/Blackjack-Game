############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

# The deck is unlimited in size.
# There are no jokers.
# The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
# The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
# Use the following list as the deck of cards:
# cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
# The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
# Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
# The computer is the dealer.

# Hint 12: Once the user is done, it's time to let the computer play. The computer should keep drawing cards as long as it has a score less than 17.

# Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.

# Hint 14: Ask the user if they want to restart the game. If they answer yes, clear the console and start a new game of blackjack and show the logo from art.py.
